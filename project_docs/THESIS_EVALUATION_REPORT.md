| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mistral (Ollama, 7B) | 91 % | 88 % | Baseline model used in deployment; strong overall balance. |
| LLaMA 3 8B (GGUF) | **94 %** | **89 %** | Highest text accuracy; slightly heavier runtime in local tests. |
| Falcon 7B Instruct | 88 % | 82 % | Struggled with rubric alignment; lower agreement on coding tasks. |

#### Latency & Cost Snapshot (Synthetic)

| Model | Avg Latency per Response | Cost Estimate (per 1k tokens) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mistral (Ollama) | **35 s** | **$0.60** | Lightweight and inexpensive for local grading. |
| LLaMA 3 8B | 42 s | $1.10 | Higher accuracy but slower and costlier if hosted in the cloud. |
| Falcon 7B | 51 s | $0.80 | Moderate cost but highest latency; less suited for large batches. |

### 2.3 Prompt Validation & Result Analysis

#### Prompt Suite Coverage

| Prompt Suite | Test Cases | Pass Rate | Avg Tokens / Prompt | Observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCQ Auto-Grader | 40 | **95 %** | 325 | Two incorrect mappings caught; prompt now enforces option order and rationale tagging. |
| Code Snippet Evaluator | 25 | **92 %** | 410 | Handles runtime errors gracefully; partial-credit logic validated on instructor unit tests. |
| Numeric & Formula Grader | 30 | **90 %** | 290 | Minor tolerance tweaks needed for scientific notation edge cases. |

#### Human vs AI Grading Gap

| Assessment Type | Avg Lecturer Score | Avg AI Score | Δ (Lecturer − AI) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCQ | 92 % | 90 % | **+2.0 pts** |
| Code Snippets | 90 % | 88 % | **+2.0 pts** |
| Numeric/Formula | 94 % | 91 % | **+3.0 pts** |
| Essay/Free Text | 89 % | 87 % | **+2.0 pts** |

![Figure 1c – Human vs AI Grading Gap](../evaluation_reports/figure_human_vs_ai_gap.png)

- Numeric grading exhibits the largest delta due to strict tolerance windows; prompts now include explicit ± ranges to reduce discrepancies.
- Essay deltas fall within the ±3 pt acceptance band. Retrieval exemplars help maintain tone alignment with lecturer feedback.
- These gaps will be recomputed with the golden dataset to provide confidence intervals in the final thesis.

### 2.4 DeepEval Quality Assessment

| Metric | Threshold | Text | Code | Multimodal | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Faithfulness | ≥ 0.85 | **0.92** | 0.88 | 0.82 | Alignment between generated feedback and source evidence. |
| Answer Relevancy | ≥ 0.80 | **0.89** | 0.86 | 0.79 | How directly responses address the lecturer’s question. |
| Rubric Coverage | ≥ 0.85 | **0.90** | 0.84 | 0.77 | Percentage of rubric criteria referenced in feedback. |

![Figure 1d – DeepEval Metric Overview](../evaluation_reports/figure_deepeval_metrics.png)

- Faithfulness and relevancy exceed thresholds for text/code, validating the prompt design.
- Rubric coverage for code trails because optional bonus criteria are not always triggered—future prompts will highlight missing points explicitly.
- Multimodal grading metrics confirm the need for enhanced OCR normalisation and better context stitching.

**Explanation Quality Diagnostics**

![Figure 1e – Explanation Length Distribution](../evaluation_reports/figure_explanation_lengths.png)

- Most explanations fall within the 80–120 word “sweet spot”, providing actionable reasoning without overwhelming lecturers.
- Long-form explanations (>120 words) are earmarked for compression before the public release.

**Multi-Agent Confidence Analysis**

![Figure 1f – Confidence vs Disagreement](../evaluation_reports/figure_confidence_scatter.png)

- Average disagreement between sequential agent runs: **11 %**.
- Confidence scores above **90 %** correlate with <10 % disagreement; anything above 20 % disagreement is surfaced as “needs review” in the UI.

### 2.5 RAG & Explainability

| Test ID | Description | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RAG‑01 | Seeding context store | Questions + criteria embedded | ✅ Pass |
| RAG‑02 | Retrieval hit rate | Top‑k contains lecturer sample | ✅ 78 % hit (synthetic) |
| RAG‑03 | Post-correction sync | Corrections appended to store | ❌ Not yet implemented |
| EXP‑01 | Criteria coverage | Explanation references each criterion | ✅ Pass on spot-check |
| EXP‑02 | Regenerate after edit | Explanation updates after manual score change | ✅ Pass |

### 2.6 Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

| Test ID | Description | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HITL‑01 | Manual override persistence | `new_score`/`new_feedback` saved | ✅ Pass |
| HITL‑02 | Collaboration share | Recipient sees shared record | ✅ Pass |
| HITL‑03 | Lecturer terminology | UI displays “Lecturer / Criteria”, parser unaffected | ✅ Pass |

### 2.7 Analytics & Reporting

| Test ID | Description | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ANA‑01 | Dashboard filter integrity | Combined filters produce non-empty dataset | ✅ Pass |
| ANA‑02 | CSV export | Matches filtered DataFrame | ✅ Pass |
| ANA‑03 | PDF export | Contains all charts, lecturer metadata | ✅ Pass |
| ANA‑04 | Insight metrics | KPI counts match DB query | ⚠ Manual cross-check only |

![Figure 3 – Feature Usage Share](../evaluation_reports/figure_usage.png)

### 2.8 Infrastructure & Deployment

| Test ID | Description | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INF‑01 | PostgreSQL schema bootstrap | Tables created automatically | ✅ Pass |
| INF‑02 | Env configuration check | `.env` values propagate to graders | ✅ Pass |
| INF‑03 | Fine-tuning assistant | LoRA pipeline accessible | ❌ Deferred |
| INF‑04 | GCP reference deployment | Cloud Run + Functions prototype | ⚠ Pending |

## 3. Summary of Findings

### Strengths

1. **Production-ready workflow:** Upload → automated grading → lecturer review → analytics pipeline exercised end-to-end with zero blocking defects.
2. **Explainability and oversight:** DeepEval scores exceed thresholds for text/code tasks; manual overrides, sharing, and audit logging are stable.
3. **Operational tooling:** Dashboard exports (CSV, PDF) and monitoring charts give lecturers immediate visibility into cohort progress and model behaviour.
4. **Model agility:** Comparative LLM analysis shows the system can swap models depending on desired accuracy vs latency/cost trade-offs.

### Limitations / Risks

1. **Benchmark coverage:** Current accuracy numbers use illustrative lecturer data; golden datasets must be finalised before public release.
2. **RAG feedback loop:** Corrections are not yet persisted to embeddings, limiting the cumulative learning effect across semesters.
3. **Analytics regression safety:** KPI validation is a manual step; CI automation is needed to prevent drift.
4. **Advanced features:** LoRA fine-tuning portal and GCP deployment guide remain backlog items.

### Roadmap Actions

1. **Finalize benchmark suite** – Curate labelled datasets, rerun ETL/grading tests, publish statistical confidence intervals.
2. **Implement correction sync** – Feed lecturer edits to the RAG store, re-evaluate DeepEval metrics, and document improvements.
3. **Automate analytics QA** – Integrate pytest/Selenium checks plus fixture comparisons into CI.
4. **Cloud pilot** – Deploy on Cloud Run + Cloud Functions + Cloud SQL, gather latency/cost telemetry, and update the product sheet.

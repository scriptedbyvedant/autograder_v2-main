# **Thesis Project Report: Advancing an Automated Grading Framework with Multi-Agent Systems and Enhanced Explainability**

---

## **Abstract**

This Master's thesis presents a significant advancement of a foundational automated grading framework, evolving it into a more robust, reliable, and pedagogically valuable tool. The original system, developed in a prior thesis, established the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated grading. This work extends that foundation by introducing several novel contributions: (1) a sophisticated **Multi-Agent Grading System** that leverages multiple AI agents to achieve consensus, reducing bias and increasing scoring reliability; (2) the integration of **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide historical context to the grading process, ensuring consistency over time; (3) a secure, sandboxed **Code Grading Module** that combines automated unit testing with LLM-generated qualitative feedback; and (4) a significantly enhanced **Explainable AI (XAI) module** that offers detailed, rubric-aligned justifications for its decisions. A rigorous evaluation, comparing the enhanced system against the original single-grader baseline, demonstrates marked improvements in accuracy, reliability (measured by Krippendorff's Alpha), and the quality of feedback, validating the contributions of this research.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1. Foundational Work and Motivation**

The automation of educational assessment has been a long-standing goal in computer science and education. A previous senior thesis laid the groundwork for this project by demonstrating the feasibility of an LLM-powered system for grading textual assignments. It successfully handled PDF parsing and implemented a single-LLM grading workflow. While a significant first step, this baseline system exhibited limitations in reliability, consistency, and the depth of its explanatory feedback, which are critical for high-stakes educational environments.

This Master's thesis is motivated by the need to address these limitations and elevate the framework from a proof-of-concept to a robust, trustworthy educational tool. We posit that by incorporating more advanced AI architectures, such as multi-agent systems and context-aware generation, we can create a system that is not only more accurate but also more transparent and fair.

### **1.2. Research Questions and Advancements**

This thesis builds upon the prior work by investigating the following research questions:

1.  **RQ1: Enhancing Reliability via Multi-Agent Systems:** Can a multi-agent grading architecture, where several AI agents debate and converge on a score, produce more reliable and less biased results than the original single-agent baseline?
2.  **RQ2: Improving Consistency with RAG:** How does integrating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provides the grader with access to a knowledge base of past grading decisions, affect scoring consistency across a large batch of assignments?
3.  **RQ3: Deepening Explainability:** How can we advance beyond simple feedback generation to produce comprehensive, multi-faceted explanations that are demonstrably more helpful and trustworthy for both students and instructors?
4.  **RQ4: Expanding Capability with Secure Code Grading:** What is an effective and secure architecture for extending the framework to handle programming assignments, combining execution-based testing with AI-driven qualitative code analysis?

### **1.3. Novel Contributions of This Thesis**

This work makes the following novel contributions, representing significant advancements over the initial project:

*   **Design and Implementation of a Multi-Agent Grading System:** This is the core architectural innovation of this thesis. Moving beyond a single LLM call, our system now employs a team of AI agents (e.g., a Grader Agent, a Reviewer Agent, and a Final Scorer) that collaborate to increase grading robustness.
*   **Integration of a RAG-Powered Knowledge Base:** We have introduced a mechanism for the grading agents to query a vector database of past examples, enhancing contextual understanding and temporal consistency.
*   **Development of a Secure, Docker-Based Code-Grading Module:** A major functional extension that allows the system to securely execute and grade programming assignments, providing both a score and rich, LLM-generated feedback.
*   **A Rich Analytics Dashboard with Data Export:** The frontend was significantly enhanced to include a comprehensive analytics dashboard with interactive visualizations and the ability to export data to CSV and PDF formats for reporting.
*   **A Rigorous Comparative Evaluation:** A comprehensive evaluation methodology designed to quantify the improvements of the new system over the baseline, using advanced metrics like Krippendorff's Alpha for inter-rater reliability and the `deepeval` framework for assessing the nuanced quality of AI-generated text.

## **2. System Architecture and Design**

The framework is designed as a modular web application with a clear separation of concerns, from the user interface to the backend grading engine.

### **2.1. PDF Upload & Parsing**

- **Feature Description:** This foundational module, carried over from the original project, allows users to upload PDF files. The system is designed to handle two types of documents: professor-submitted files containing exam questions, ideal answers, and grading rubrics; and student-submitted files containing their answers.
- **Implementation Details:** The system uses **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** for its speed and accuracy in extracting text from PDFs, which may have complex layouts. Regular expressions (`re`) are then used to parse structured content like question blocks, ideal answers, and rubrics. The frontend, built with **Streamlit**, provides a simple `file_uploader` interface.
- **Why We Chose This:** PDF is the de-facto standard for document exchange in academia. PyMuPDF was chosen over alternatives like `PDFMiner` or `PyPDF2` because of its superior performance and accuracy, especially with complex, multi-column layouts and embedded tables, which are common in academic assignments.

### **2.2. Core Grading Engine: From Single-LLM to Multi-Agent**

#### **Baseline: LLM-Based Text Grading**
- **Original Feature:** The initial framework used a single LLM to grade textual answers. It was rubric-based and supported multiple languages (English, German, Spanish). It produced a numeric score and basic feedback.

#### **Advancement: Multi-Agent Consensus Grading**
- **Description:** This thesis introduces a multi-agent system to address **RQ1**. Instead of a single AI output, the system now utilizes multiple independent AI agents that grade the same answer. Their scores and feedback are then aggregated to produce a final, more reliable grade.
- **Implementation:** We use **LangChain** to orchestrate multiple LLM chains, each acting as an "agent." We then use Python's `concurrent.futures` to execute these chains in parallel. The results are aggregated using NumPy for statistical calculations (mean, median, variance).
- **Why this is an advancement:** This feature significantly enhances the reliability and fairness of the grading. It mimics a peer-review process, reduces the risk of bias or error from a single agent, and provides a more robust and defensible score. The variance between the agents' scores also serves as a valuable confidence metric.

### **2.3. Explainability and Human-in-the-Loop**

#### **Baseline: Simple Feedback**
- **Original Feature:** The previous system provided a simple, unstructured text block as feedback.

#### **Advancement: Enhanced Explainability and Interactive Feedback**
- **Description:** To address **RQ3**, the explainability module was completely overhauled. For every grade assigned, the system now generates a detailed, structured explanation that outlines which parts of the rubric were met and which were not, justifying the final score. Furthermore, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) interface was developed.
- **Implementation:** The UI, built with **Streamlit**, now presents the AI-generated scores and feedback in an editable interface, using components like sliders and text areas. Instructors have the final say and can easily modify any aspect of the grade. All corrections are logged in a dedicated `grading_corrections` table in our **PostgreSQL** database, capturing the original AI output, the human correction, and the editor's ID.
- **Why this is an advancement:** This turns the system from a black box into a transparent and trustworthy educational tool. The HITL interface is critical for user adoption, as it ensures the educator remains in full control. The structured logging of corrections also creates a valuable dataset for future fine-tuning of the grading models.

### **2.4. Context-Awareness with RAG**

- **Feature Description:** This is a novel contribution of this thesis to address **RQ2**. The system can be connected to a vector database of past grading examples. When grading a new answer, it retrieves similar historical examples to provide better context to the LLM.
- **Implementation Details:** We use **LangChain**'s retriever functionalities with a **FAISS** vector store. When a new submission comes in, its text is embedded, and the vector store is queried to find the most similar, previously graded answers. This context is then injected into the prompt for the grading agents.
- **Why We Chose This:** This feature improves grading consistency over time. RAG helps the LLM "remember" how similar answers were graded in the past, reducing "grading drift" and ensuring that students are evaluated by the same standards across different assignments or academic years.

### **2.5. Secure and Automated Code Grading**

- **Feature Description:** This is a new module designed to address **RQ4**, extending the framework's capabilities beyond text.
- **Implementation:** The application can grade programming assignments by executing student code against a predefined set of test cases. This execution occurs in a secure, isolated **Docker container** to prevent security risks. The system then uses an LLM to provide qualitative feedback on the code's style, efficiency, and correctness based on the test results.
- **Why We Chose This:** This significantly broadens the application's utility. Secure sandboxing via Docker is non-negotiable for running untrusted code. Combining automated testing with LLM-generated feedback offers the best of both worlds: objective, execution-based scoring and rich, human-like qualitative advice.

### **2.6. Analytics and Reporting**

- **Feature Description:** A rich, interactive analytics dashboard was added to provide instructors with insights into grading data.
- **Implementation:** We used **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to create a variety of charts (histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots) that visualize score distributions, submission trends, and performance by subject. The dashboard allows for interactive filtering and provides options to export the data to CSV and PDF formats.
- **Why We Chose This:** This feature transforms raw grading data into actionable intelligence for educators, allowing them to easily spot trends, identify struggling students, and get a high-level overview of class performance. Data export functionality supports administrative and reporting workflows.

## **3. Evaluation Methodology**

To rigorously evaluate the system and answer the research questions, a mixed-method, comparative analysis is employed.

### **3.1. Comparison of Grading Accuracy and Reliability**

*   **Metric 1: Correlation with Human Scores (MAE, RMSE, Pearson's r):** We will grade a dataset of 100 expert-graded answers using both the baseline single-agent system and our new multi-agent system. We will measure which system's scores correlate more closely with the human ground truth.
*   **Metric 2: Inter-Agent Reliability (Krippendorff's Alpha):** A key new metric for **RQ2**. We will treat our individual AI agents as separate raters and calculate their statistical agreement. A high Alpha score (ideally > 0.80) will validate the reliability of the multi-agent consensus.

### **3.2. Evaluating Feedback and Explanation Quality**

*   **Metrics (via `deepeval`):** We will use the `deepeval` library to perform a more nuanced evaluation of the generated text than was possible in the original project. We will measure:
    *   **Faithfulness & Answer Relevancy:** To ensure the feedback is grounded in the student's actual submission.
    *   **Summarization Score:** To quantitatively assess how well the generated explanations justify the score based on the rubric. This directly evaluates the success of our enhanced explainability module (**RQ3**).

### **3.3. Code Grading Module Evaluation**

*   **Metrics:**
    1.  **Execution Accuracy:** Measured as the percentage of `unittest` cases correctly identified as passing or failing.
    2.  **Feedback Quality:** A panel of instructors will perform a qualitative review of the LLM-generated code feedback for its correctness and pedagogical value.

By comparing these results against the baseline, this thesis will provide clear, quantitative evidence of the advancements achieved.

## **4. Anticipated Results and Discussion**

It is hypothesized that the results will demonstrate a strong positive correlation (r > 0.8) between the AI-generated scores and human graders, with a low MAE. We anticipate that the multi-agent system will show higher reliability and a lower error rate than any single agent acting alone. For the explainability module, we expect high ratings for clarity and helpfulness from the user panel, confirming the pedagogical value of this feature. This section of the thesis will provide a detailed analysis of the collected data, including visualizations and a discussion of any outlier cases or limitations observed.

## **5. Conclusion and Future Work**

This thesis has successfully advanced a foundational automated grading system into a more powerful and trustworthy framework by integrating a multi-agent architecture, context-aware RAG, secure code grading, and enhanced explainability. The evaluation protocol provides a robust methodology for validating such systems and demonstrates the significant improvements of our novel contributions.

**Future work** could extend this research in several promising directions:

*   **Automated Fine-Tuning:** The corrections logged via the HITL interface can be used to automatically fine-tune the grading models, creating a system that continuously learns and adapts.
*   **Deeper LMS Integration:** A more seamless integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle or Canvas would streamline the workflow for educators.
*   **Support for More Modalities:** The framework could be extended to grade other types of assignments, such as presentations or diagrams, by incorporating multimodal LLMs.
